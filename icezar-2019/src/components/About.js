                                    My name is Cezar Balaita and I’m a software professional who loves to solve problems.<br/>
                                    I’ve been doing it for decades.<br/> 
                                    One of my hobbies is photography. I enjoy catching animals, birds, insects and people on camera.<br/>
                                    Affiliate Marketing is the industry I’ve specialized in.<br/> 
                                    Did you know that you can make $$$ just by having a website?<br/>
                                    Building a dynamic website is not as simple as you’ve been told or read online.<br/> 
                                    SEO is hard and it evolves every day. Don’t struggle on your own. Hire me!<br/>
                                    I enjoy challenges. Playing board games relaxes me.<br/>
                                    My home is international. I work mostly remotely because it’s the most efficient and productive way.<br/>
                                    I lived in Bucharest, Toronto, Los Angeles, Vancouver, San Francisco, Santa Barbara.<br/>
                                    I’m an EU and Canadian citizen and, a US resident.<br/>
                                    Let me know if you need help.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Have an amazing day!
                                </p>
