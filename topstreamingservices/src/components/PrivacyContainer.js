              <p>TopStreamingServices.com, is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</p>

              <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes and governs the information collection, use, and sharing practices of TopStreamingServices.com and its corporate affiliates, subsidiaries, and divisions as may change from time to time (collectively, TopStreamingServices.com,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) with respect to TopStreamingServices.com websites, mobile applications, and other digital and interactive services that link to this Privacy Policy (together, the “Services”).</p>

              <p>Before you submit any information on or through the Services, please carefully review this Policy together with our <NavLink to="/terms"><span className="text-muted">Terms Of Use</span></NavLink> and any other documents referred to therein to understand our views and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. By using any part of the Services, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as further outlined in this Policy. We will continue to evaluate this Policy as we update and expand the Services and our offerings, and we may make changes to the Policy accordingly. Any changes will be posted here and you should check this page periodically for updates. Your continued use of the Services will signify acceptance of the terms of the updated Policy.</p>

              <p>We're always working to make our services even better. One of the ways we do that is by analyzing information we collect and receive about users in order to figure out what they might be interested in. This helps us develop more engaging content and provide more effective advertising, which enables us to keep most of our services free.</p>

              <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information we collect and receive about users. There are three things you should keep in mind as you read it:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>First, the TopStreamingServices.com Privacy Policy applies to TopStreamingServices.com websites, mobile apps, other online services and anything else that links to or refers to this policy. To keep things simple, we refer to all these services as our "Services."</li>
                <li>Second, the Privacy Policy applies no matter what computer or device you use to access our Services</li>
                <li>Third, we may provide additional information about the privacy practices for some of our Services. Although this Privacy Policy applies to all our services that refer or link to it, you should read the additional information, too. Some of this information is linked from various places in the Privacy Policy, and some is available through the individual Services that you use. Products and services that do not link to this Privacy Policy, such as those offered outside of the United States may have different privacy policies and practices that are not subject to this our Privacy Policy.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>We've done our best to keep this Privacy Policy short and simple, but if you have any questions about it, we hope you'll <NavLink to="/contact"><span className="text-muted">let us know</span></NavLink>.</p>
