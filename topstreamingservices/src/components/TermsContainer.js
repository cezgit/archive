No narrowed construction, modification or invalidation of any portion of the Terms and Conditions shall affect the construction, validity or enforceability of such portion in any other jurisdiction. No waiver by TopStreamingServices of any term or condition of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or of any other term or condition, and TopStreamingServices’s failure to assert any right or demand compliance with any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.</p>

              <p>Except where prohibited by law, as a condition of you clicking acceptance of these Terms and Conditions and/or accessing and/or using the Websites, you agree that (1) any and all disputes and causes of action you seek to bring arising out of or connected with the Websites or the Materials shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, and exclusively by final and binding arbitration in California within one year from the date that the cause of action arose (or, if multiple cause of actions are involved, from the date that the first cause of action arose), with such arbitration conducted pursuant to the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association; and (2) judgment upon such arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, no arbitration brought pursuant hereto shall be joined to any other action or arbitration.</p>

              <p>The rules governing arbitration are different than those in court.  Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages as a court.  Except as may otherwise be provided in AAA’s Consumer Due Process Protocol that allows consumers to file certain claims in small claims court, you understand that by accepting these Terms and Conditions, you are giving up your right to a trial in court, either with or without a jury.</p>

              <p>To the fullest extent permitted at law, under no circumstances will you be permitted to obtain an award for, and by accessing and/or using the Sites you waive all rights to claim, punitive, incidental, consequential or any other damages (including multiplied and/or increased damages and/or attorneys’ fees and court costs) for, any dispute or cause of action that you may have that relates in whole or part to the Websites and/or the Materials. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Terms and Conditions or otherwise, your recovery with respect to any and all claims, judgments, and awards for which you are entitled shall, to the fullest extent permitted at law, be limited to your actual out-of-pocket costs incurred, excluding attorneys’ fees and court costs.</p>

              <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Terms and Conditions, TopStreamingServices may at any time seek injunctive or other appropriate relief against you and/or against others, in any state or federal court in the state of California and/or in any other court chosen by TopStreamingServices in the event that TopStreamingServices believes that there is a violation, or a threatened violation, of any of TopStreamingServices’s intellectual property rights and, in such case, you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such court.</p>
